# UserProfileEditor

---

## Description

Creating an application integrated with the Personal Assistant, enables the application to have a controlled dialogue to interact faster and more human friendly than ever.
This is a system that requires the Personal Assistant, which is the controller for all the components and CADE, which handles the voice logic to enable the developers an easy access to the voice action events, which can be human friendly!

The UserProfileEditor lets you modify your user's attributes which are stored on the PersonalizationManager server.

Creating an application in Android is simple, so it is to integrate the following components.
First it is required to install the Personal Assistant application to enable the service that communicates the events.
Second, DDDs are required to be created, so the application can handle voice recognition easily.
Once all the steps are configured it should be ok to start creating an Android application and to integrate the components required for the PA and the CADE. To do so, follow this steps:
